•	Our IDS project is about the top 250 football transfers that have taken place each year from the 2000-2001 season to the 2017-2018 season.

•	Basically football players have contracts with the team they play for. After the contract expires the player can either sign a new contract or move to a team that is willing to pay his transfer fee.

•	Our dataset contains football transfers from the 2000 - 2001 season to the 2018-2019 season with 4701 rows and  11 columns.

•	The variables in the dataset are :-
1.	Name of the player.
2.	Age of the player.
3.	Team from which the player is getting transferred.
4.	Team to which the player is getting transferred.
5.	The league to which he is getting transferred.
6.	The season when he got transferred.
7.	Market value of the player.
8.	Transfer fee paid for the player (need not be equal to market value).


•	We will be plotting the market value of players with other variables (like age, position they play etc.)  to see the trends in the market value.

•	We will also try to predict the range where the market value of the player falls in the next season.

•	We came across this dataset in www.kaggle.com
